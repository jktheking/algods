 * String structure: c1rc2, this format can cover whole problem string,
 * lps in begning, lps in middle, lps in end.
 * LPS function structure: LPS(i,j)
 * where i points to c1 and j points to c2
 *
 * Case1: When c1==c2
 *
 *  there can be 4 decision situations:
 *  caseA#1. c1 and c2 both are part of the solution, then r has to be palindrome.
 *
 *      lps = 2 + r.length;  provided that LPS(r) is equal to r.length
 *
 *  caseA#2. c1 is included in the solution but not c2 =>  0 + LPS(c1r) even though c1==c2.
 *  caseA#3. c2 is included in the solution but not c1 => 0 + LPS(rc2) even though c1==c2
 *  caseA#4. c1 and c2 both are not included in the solution => 0 + LPS(r) even though c1==2.
 *
 *  caseA#4. will come as sub-solution of caseA#2 and caseA#3.
 *
 * Case2: When c1!=c2
 *
 *  caseB#1. c1 is included in the solution but not c2 => 0 + LPS(c1r)
 *  caseB#2. c2 is included in the solution but not c1 => 0 + LPS(rc2)
 *  caseB#3. c1 and c2 both are not included in the solution => 0 + LPS(r)

	 * <pre>
	 * Cell Meaning:
	 * dp[i][j] represents whether the substring starting at index i and ending at index j (both inclusive) is a palindrome.
	 * If the substring is a palindrome, its length will be stored; otherwise, ZERO will be stored.
	 *
	 * Problem String Representation: S = C1rC2; to obtain the tabulated solution, we first solve for smaller substrings, starting with 'r'.
	 * Initially, we consider 'r' of length 1, then length 2, and so forth.
	 *
	 * Given that 'r' is the middle part of the string representation (C1rC2) and must be solved before the complete string
	 * string is considered -- we start solving the problem from the diagonal of the matrix as a rule of thumb.
	 * - The diagonal represents r with length 1.
	 * - The next cell ahead of  the diagonal cells represent r with length 2, and so on.
	 *
	 * Note: How to calculate 'r' at a given cell S = C1rC2?
	 * The length of 'r' is j - i - 1, and its value is stored in the cell dp[i+1][j-1].
	 *
	 * Refer to the recursive solution for the final implementation:
	 *
	 * if (dp[i+1][j-1] != 0) {
	 * // r is a palindrome
	 *     dp[i][j] = 2 + dp[i+1][j-1];
	 * } else {
	 * // r is not a palindrome
	 *     dp[i][j] = 0;
	 * }
