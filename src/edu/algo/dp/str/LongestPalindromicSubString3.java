 * Case1: When c1==c2

 *  caseA#1. c1 and c2 both are part of the solution, then r has to be palindrome.
 *
 *      lps = 2 + r.length;  provided that LPS(r) is equal to r.length
 *
 *  caseA#2. c1 is included in the solution but not c2 =>  0 + LPS(c1r) even though c1==c2.
 *  caseA#3. c2 is included in the solution but not c1 => 0 + LPS(rc2) even though c1==c2
 *  caseA#4. c1 and c2 both are not included in the solution => 0 + LPS(r) even though c1==2.
 *
 *  caseA#4. will come as sub-solution of caseA#2 and caseA#3.
 *
 * Case2: When c1!=c2
 *
 *  caseB#1. c1 is included in the solution but not c2 => 0 + LPS(c1r)
