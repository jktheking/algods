	 * 
	 * 1. In stack-oriented programming languages
	 * 2. Graph algorithms: depth-first search can be implemented with stacks(or with recursion)
	 * 3. Finding Euler-Cycles in a graph
	 * 4.Finding strongly connected components in a graph
	 * 
	 * 
	 * Balancing of symbols
	 * Infix-to-postfix conversion
	 * Evaluation of postfix expression 
	 * Implementing function calls (including recursion)
	 * Finding of spans (finding spans in stock markets, refer to Problems section)
	 * Page-visited history in a Web browser [Back Buttons]
	 *  Undo sequence in a text editor
	 *  Matching Tags in HTML and XML

	 * Dijkstra's SHUNTING-YARD algorithm or 	DIJKSTRA'S INTERPRETER
	 * 
	 * A method for parsing mathematical expressions
	 * 
	 * The shunting-yard algorithm is stacked-based : one stack for the numbers and second stack is 
	 * for the operators.
	 * 
	 * The shunting-yard algorithm has been later generalized into operator-precedence parsing.
	 * 
	 * Intuition -> this is something like an interpreter, it can read source code line by line and 
	 * process it accordingly.
