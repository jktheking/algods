The Tree-Traversal Visualization Trick: Marking Nodes
=========================================================

Imagine walking around the tree with a pencil, starting at the root and following its edges.

Steps:
Pre-order: Mark the node when you first arrive at it. 


In-order: Mark the node when you pass it from below (after visiting its left subtree).


Post-order: Mark the node when you leave(means you will never come back to it) it after visiting both subtrees.
